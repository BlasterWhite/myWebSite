The project integrated various technologies to ensure efficiency and scalability.\n\n## Technologies Employed\n- ### Docker :\n   - Docker was strategically chosen for its seamless deployment and scalability features. This containerization solution provided an easy and efficient means to manage the application.\n- ### Bash :\n   - The project leveraged Bash scripting to continuously monitor for new markdown documents. Upon detecting a new document, the script seamlessly triggered a PHP script for conversion.\n\n- ### Php :\n   - Two distinct PHP scripts were employed for different functionalities. The first script efficiently converted markdown files to PDF, while the second script generated a corresponding billing document.\n\n[Source Code](https://github.com/BlasterWhite/MarkdownToPDF/tree/main)",

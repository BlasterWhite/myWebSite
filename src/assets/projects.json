This project made me learn a lot about the project management and the importance of the evaluation of a project.\n\nProject Evaluation is a web application that allows the user to evaluate a project. The user can create a project and add the different tasks that compose it. Then, he can evaluate the project by giving a score to each task. The application will then calculate the score of the project and display it to the user.\n\n![](screens/evaluation.jpg)",

We planned to implement the following:\n- RFID chip for chicken counting\n- Temperature sensor\n- Servo motor for opening/closing the door\n- Scale for weighing water\n- Image recognition for egg counting\n- Data transmission to a website\n\nI took care of the website and the Arduino data transmission.\n### The Arduino:\nIn the project, I handled the data transmission to a computer via the network using encapsulation of the **UDP protocol**. I used an Arduino Uno with an Ethernet Shield for this purpose.\n### The Website:\nTo create a Human-Machine Interface, I set up a website with a NodeJS server in the backend that receives UDP data over the network and communicates with the web page via web sockets.  \nThe website is divided into 4 parts:\n1. Home - All information is displayed visually\n2. Logs - All information is displayed in a table with reception times\n3. Settings - Where the server's receiving parameters can be viewed\n4. Help - Information in case of problems\n\n![](screens/projetBac1.png)",

This containerization solution provided an easy and efficient means to manage the application.\n- ### Bash :\n   - The project leveraged Bash scripting to continuously monitor for new markdown documents. Upon detecting a new document, the script seamlessly triggered a PHP script for conversion.\n\n- ### Php :\n   - Two distinct PHP scripts were employed for different functionalities. The first script efficiently converted markdown files to PDF, while the second script generated a corresponding billing document.\n\n[Source Code](https://github.com/BlasterWhite/MarkdownToPDF/tree/main)",

These components are completely configurable, to display certain elements such as the formatting of dates, times and names.\n\nFinally, we updated the application program by adding the newly developed components. This application program is configured in another application, so that a non-computer scientist can configure the appearance of this application to suit the customer.\n\nThis project confirmed the team's cohesion, notably with the setting up of a coding dojo to finish off the project's final touches.",

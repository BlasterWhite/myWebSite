**data:**\
During my apprenticeship in the CYIM company I encounter many project with Project Evaluation is a part of.
This project made me learn a lot about the project management and the importance of the evaluation of a project.

### Knight's Tour Chess Algorithm

Implementation of a knight's tour algorithm on a chessboard

As part of a project during my first year of my Computer Science degree, I developed an algorithm to solve the knight's tour problem on a chessboard.
The problem is simple: a knight is placed on the chessboard and it needs to visit every square exactly once without revisiting any square.
After finding a possible graph, I display it graphically.
In a final version of the program, I added the capability to create a closed tour, meaning the knight will end up on the same square it started from.

### Connected Chicken Coop
**date:** \

**data:**\
For my Baccalaureate oral exam, I created a chicken coop that transmits captured information to a website.
Project Description:

My two teammates and I developed a solution to make a backyard chicken habitat connected. We planned to implement the following:

- RFID chip for chicken counting
- Temperature sensor
- Servo motor for opening/closing the door
- Scale for weighing water
- Image recognition for egg counting
- Data transmission to a website

I took care of the website and the Arduino data transmission.
The Arduino:

In the project, I handled the data transmission to a computer via the network using encapsulation of the UDP protocol. I used an Arduino Uno with an Ethernet Shield for this purpose.
The Website:

To create a Human-Machine Interface, I set up a website with a NodeJS server in the backend that receives UDP data over the network and communicates with the web page via web sockets.
The website is divided into 4 parts:

1. Home - All information is displayed visually
2. Logs - All information is displayed in a table with reception times
3. Settings - Where the server's receiving parameters can be viewed 
4. Help - Information in case of problems


### Portfolio
**date:** \
**thumbnail:** /src/assets/screens/How-to-make-portfolio-for-design-admission.jpg \
**data:**\
In the process of developing my resume and showcasing my projects, I created a website.
I envisioned the website in several steps:

- Page visualization and creation of a site hierarchy
- Creation of a graphic design
- Creation of a layout mockup using Figma
- Development of the site using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Website deployment using a web hosting service

The Challenges:

To create this site, I challenged myself to do everything on my own, which means not copying and pasting from websites like StackOverflow or others.
Similarly, when encountering problems, I only sought help from online documentation such as w3school.com or MDN web docs.


The final step was populating the site with all the projects I had already done and filling the other pages with all the information.

Creation of a showcase website as part of a study project

As part of a project for my first year of my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, I collaborated with a team to develop a showcase website for a fictional company called KohFrais.
Our work was divided into several steps:

- Creation of a graphic design
- Designing the logo and graphic assets
- Development of the website
- Deployment
- Presentation defense

Throughout the project, we used Gitlab at our university to save our work step by step, which allowed me to learn the importance of tools like git.


### Yams CLI

**data:**\
Creation of a Yams game in a terminal

As part of a project for my first year of my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, I developed a Yams/Yathzee game in the terminal.
My Yams game was created in several steps:

- Creation of initial visuals using ASCII art
- Development of the program using PseudoCode
- Programming in C
- Testing phase

Throughout this project, I followed the typical software development steps of modeling, programming, and testing.
I also learned the importance of using a version control system like Git.
